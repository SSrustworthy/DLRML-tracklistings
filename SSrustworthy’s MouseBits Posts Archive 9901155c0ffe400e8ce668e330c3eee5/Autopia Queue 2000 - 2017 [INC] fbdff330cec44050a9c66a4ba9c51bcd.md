# Autopia Queue 2000 - 2017 [INC]

*Posted by Aubrey on 09/02/2022*

I've been taking a look at old posts to compile a track listing collection. It seems that no single list has been compiled from all this information, so I'm going to take my best shot given the information I have.

# PeopleMover ca. 1976

This the track listing for the PeopleMover circa 1976, as posted by Djali999 (with Capitol Hi-Q reel numbers added):

1   It's Sprinkling - Jan Kimberly   MEOS-3 - Media Music Release No. 12 - No. 3 - Musical Weather Report [Reel M-128]

2   Vast Resources - Jan Kimberly   MEOS-4 - Media Music Release No. 12 - No. 4 - Modern Life-Styles [Reel L-178]

3   Decisions - Jan Kimberly   MEOS-8 - Media Music Release No. 12 - No. 8 - Productivity [Reel L-180]

4   Today's Action #10 - Neil Amsterdam   MEHS-1 - Media Music Release No. 8 - No. 1 - Today's Action [Reel X-168]

Using that information, we can fill in wedroy1923's information from this thread on the PeopleMover playlist (the numbering should start at Cue O as #1 but I've left it as is for reference):

01.  Cue N (It's Windy)

02.  Cue O (It's Sprinkling)

03.  Cue P (Vast Resources)

04.  Cue Q (Decisions)

05.  Cue D (Today's Action #1)

06.  Cue A (March AKA A Month in Harmony #3)

07.  Cue C (Window Shopping)

# Autopia Queue

Ok, so now we can fill in the blanks for the Autopia queue listing ca. 2012, given that "Source Cue N" = "It's Windy" and "Source Cue P" = "Vast Resources":

1. Outdoor Life #1 - Henrik Nielsen   MEGS-8 - Media Music Release No. 7 - No. 8 - Outdoor Life / Supersoundic Strings [L-163]
2. ~~Outdoor Life #2 - Henrik Nielsen   MEGS-8 - Media Music Release No. 7 - No. 8 - Outdoor Life / Supersoundic Strings [L-163]~~

*Note: I lined up the source video of the billboards with each of these tracks in Audacity, and there's about a 15 second gap between Outdoor Life #1 and the Monorail song. It's unfortunately inaudible to hear if anything is playing due to the announcements, as all audio is turned way down when those play. So I would assume there's a gap, or an extended version of the monorail song, but not enough time for Outdoor Life #2 to be played.*

1. Monorail Song/Nation on Wheels - Disneyland Forever / A Musical History of Disneyland Edit: These are two separate songs, not a medley
2. It's Windy - Jan Kimberly   MEOS-3 - Media Music Release No. 12 - No. 3 - Musical Weather Report [Reel M-128]
3. Vast Resources - Jan Kimberly   MEOS-4 - Media Music Release No. 12 - No. 4 - Modern Life-Styles [Reel L-178]
4. Today's Action #10 - Neil Amsterdam   MEHS-1 - Media Music Release No. 8 - No. 1 - Today's Action [Reel X-168]
5. Window Shopping - Robert Ascot   MELS-9 - Media Music Release No. 11 - No. 9 - Then & Now/Here & There [Reel L-176]
6. Neutral Strings #2 - Neil Amsterdam   MEHS-7 - Media Music Release No. 8 - No. 7 - Neutral Strings in Motion [Reel L-99]
7. Neutral Strings #3 - Neil Amsterdam   MEHS-7 - Media Music Release No. 8 - No. 7 - Neutral Strings in Motion [Reel L-99] Edit: See note below.

*I determined (with outside help) from this video that Neutral Strings #2 plays followed by Neutral Strings #3, so that fits nicely at the bottom of this partial listing. See [https://youtu.be/U4CD_DzUZeQ?t=66](https://youtu.be/U4CD_DzUZeQ?t=66)*

It's unclear to me whether this is the full Autopia queue loop, but this is all we have for now, especially since Honda's takeover has introduced new (and arguably less catchy) BGM. Seems like it was always too soft to hear, which is partly why more work hasn't been done on this loop.

If you're wondering where to find Media Music to download, check Youtube. The kind people of the librarymusicthemes forum also post things from time to time.

For reference, it seems that the old loop was still in place as of July 2016 (Honda opened their version in June 2016 after refurb started in Jan 2016). It may have been replaced when Asimo and Bird showed up in March of 2017.

Old loop still present in July 2016:

New loop can be heard in March 2017:
