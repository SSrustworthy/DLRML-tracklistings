# Dole - The Flavor of Hawaii

*Posted by Aubrey on 09/28/2022*

The Dole sponsor video that played at the Enchanted Tiki Room used Capitol Records production music in the underlying soundtrack. The songs used were:

1. **Moonlight in Hawaii (Travel Hawaii #2) -** Ib Glindemann (composer)
2. **Hawaii Holidays (AKA Travel Hawaii #1) -** Ib Glindemann (composer)
3. **Beach Party -** Ib Glindemann (composer)

Tracks 1 and 2 were originally released on Hi-"Q" X reel X-94, and re-released on Media Music Release No. 2, MEDS-8 "Travel The World". They are both currently available to listen to on Ole Georg Media's soundcloud in very nice stereo:

Beach Party can be found on any of the following albums: Media Music Release No. 2 MEDS-8 'Travel the World', **OR** OGM Media Music #1 international, **OR** Capitol Hi-"Q" Reel X-94

Finally, as C33 pointed out, in later years (this video retired around 2012 I think) there was a "Dole Product Parade" segment that plays immediately after the main film prior to the start of the preshow. The track that plays here is called **O Makalapua.** It is composed by Kapono Beamer and was released on album SAS-0050 - Authentic Polynesia 1 - Hawaii & Tonga under the Sonoton Authentic Series library label in 1996.
