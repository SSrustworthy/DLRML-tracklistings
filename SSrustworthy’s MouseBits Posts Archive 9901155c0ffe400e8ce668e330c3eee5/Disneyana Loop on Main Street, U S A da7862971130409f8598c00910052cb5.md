Recording was done on my phone, and is a little quiet. Also note that these is a sudden skip in the recording during the Disney Medley track at 9:09.675 for a little less than ten seconds. You need to clip it here and then realign it with the source track. This occurred because I wanted to take a picture of something and very quickly realized that my phone stopped the recording.

There are several fades throughout this loop. The loop lengths as I calculated them do not account for the full fade-in or fade-out. The edit lengths also do not account An accurate reconstruction would necessitate lining source tracks up with the recording.
