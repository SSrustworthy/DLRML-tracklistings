# Autopia March 2017 Queue Music

*Posted by Aubrey on 10/30/2022*

I bet you thought that the Autopia (presented by HONDA) queue music introduced with Bird and Asimo [in March 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPzkQ_Id2i8) was specially commissioned as a bunch of mindless pop... Well, you were wrong. I mean, it is mindless pop, but it's mostly production music licensed from Audio Network.

So here is the track list that you so desperately did not want, but also didn't expect:

# **Autopia Queue (3/24/2017 â€” present)**

1. Bang On - David Krajic - Synth Electro Pop

2. One Minute to Win it - Henry Jackman - Wreck-it Ralph OST

*All Audio Network tracks are denoted with the ANW album number. Other tracks (besides Wreck-it Ralph) are available on various streaming platforms. I didn't check Amazon.*

## A few notes on compiling the loop:

I went through about ten videos from Walking With The Mouse (great YouTube channel - many of the videos include the wait time in the queue, so you can hear larger loop snippets!). The "Bird" character breaks into a long-winded safety spiel for a whole 1.5 minutes pretty consistently, during which time the music is turned way down and is inaudible in these recordings. As a result, it's difficult to hear where one song starts and another ends. By matching up the overlapping listings from different videos, I was able to identify all songs in the loop.

An induction would be possible if you want to hold up the line. The covered section where the really-slow-moving videos of Asimo/Bird loading up the car, visiting places on a map, etc. plays the queue music really loudly by the videos without any dialogue. But this loop isn't that great, so I doubt anyone's going to do that for the sake of edit points.

Happy synth-electro-pop listening, my friends.
