# Mickey and Minnie‚Äôs Runaway Railway Queue Music

## MMRR Lobby loop

Just inside of the MMRR queue, before reaching the ‚ÄúEarly Ears‚Äù exhibit, there is a loop that I am calling the MMRR "Lobby loop". It is currently the general land BGM as well, although it seems possible that there is new land BGM that will be unveiled with the rest of the land in March. These are reorchestrations of themes from Christopher Willis' compositions for the Mickey Mouse shorts that debuted in 2013.

## MMRR Queue Loop

The queue loop plays in the remaining area up to and including the theaters themselves. It does not play in the area near the trains.

The loop is dynamic and the instrumentation changes between exhibits (Early Ears: early jazz, Golden Ears: modern jazz, and Modern Ears: orchestral). It does not play in the area immediately surrounding the Disco Mickey Mouse exhibit. That has a separate loop entirely composed of selections from the Mickey Mouse Disco (1979) and Mousercise (1982) albums.

I created a contiguous mix of live videos of the queue (sometimes several at once). The loop length is ~00:34:06. The volume is in and out, but overall the music is well audible. Every once in a while there are voices from the YouTubers that unknowlingly contributed their work to this project, but I minimized sources with clearly audible voices whenever possible.

I would love some help with IDing if anyone has the time. The unknowns may be from the Christopher Willis compositions for the newer Mickey Mouse shorts (2013). He has apparently uploaded most (if not all) of his compositions to his SoundCloud:

## MMRR Queue - Disco Exhibit

I believe that the following tracklist represents the Disco exhibit loop based on a few videos I‚Äôve found with song transitions.

**Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway Queue - Disco Exhibit**
Loop length unknown

1. Disco Mickey Mouse - Mickey Mouse Disco
2. Ducks Dance, Too - Mousercise
3. Mousercise Medley - Mousercise
4. Macho Duck - Mickey Mouse Disco
5. Watch Out For Goofy! - Mickey Mouse Disco

<Possibly missing more?>

## MMRR Exit Loop

There is an exit loop in the Enginear Souvenirs shop as well.

The queue exit is likely the same loop as DHS (thanks for verifying StarWarsGalaxysEdge!) This tracklist needs to be compiled as well.
