# Park Sensory Podcast

*Posted by Aubrey on 1/21/2023*

Recently, doddles brought the excellent Park Sensory podcast to our attention on the Discord. This is one to bookmark! As described by [their website](https://park-sensory.simplecast.com/episodes),

> Do you long for the sounds from Disney theme parks? Do you miss the music from your favorite attraction, themed area, or simply miss the atmosphere heard through each land? If you simply need that Disney fix, Park Sensory is the perfect complimentary podcast for your time away from the parks. From ride thrus to simply sitting on a bench on Main Street U.S.A., Park Sensory will provide those subtle nuanced sounds through binaural audio recordings.
> 

The episodes are all live recordings of attractions, “park bench” moments, and area loops (currently from the Disneyland resort). There are no intros/outros or any talking from the host - the episodes are really just straight up recordings with probably some post-processing. 

All episodes can be downloaded from the Park Sensory website. Here’s some area music recordings that are nice to have:
