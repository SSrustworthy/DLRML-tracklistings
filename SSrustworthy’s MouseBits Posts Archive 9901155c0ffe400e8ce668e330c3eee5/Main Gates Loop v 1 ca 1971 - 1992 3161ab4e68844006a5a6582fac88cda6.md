# Main Gates Loop v.1: ca. 1971 - 1992

*Posted by Aubrey on 09/24/2022*

Although this topic is 10 years old, I think it's worth adding some notes here on the loop. After C33 posted his samples, nobody bothered to actually write out a final track list! So here we are.

Pixelated kindly dug up those samples from the archives for me, but I don't have a reference recording, so **I am only listing the order of play and not the edits**. DisneyChris has posted a recreation on YouTube/his site, which I am linking below. He does claim that he has used a reference recording to make his, so I would refer to that if you want edit points as some of the medleys are indeed cut up. Also important to note is that track 1/15, 4/18, 6/24, and 9/29 are repeats.

Some great discussion of the original WDW Entrance loop (which is similar but not identical) can be found here:
