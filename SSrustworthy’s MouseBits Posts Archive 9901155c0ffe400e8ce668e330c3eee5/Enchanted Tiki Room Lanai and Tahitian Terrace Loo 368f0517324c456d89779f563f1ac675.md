# Enchanted Tiki Room Lanai and Tahitian Terrace Loops

*Posted by Aubrey on 10/30/2022*

Some notes on the Enchanted Tiki Room Lanai music ‚Äî

There have been three versions of this ‚ÄúLanai‚Äù track, which has historically played in the courtyard of the Enchanted Tiki Room between garden pre-show showings [3].

# **Version 1: 1963 ‚Äì 1976**

Most of the information I‚Äôve managed to gather on this loop is thanks to Mike Cozart/DL FLIGHT 295 of the TOMORROWLOUNGE from his early posts on the Magic Music forum.

In 1963, Disneyland used a reel of Martin Denny exotica/tropical music in the garden show area. All of the Martin Denny group‚Äôs bird calls on the tracks were left intact and (to Mike‚Äôs ears, as he apparently owns a show copy of the music reel) the loop sounded more South American in style than Hawaiian [4]. Although the exact date is unclear, the music was changed to a slower set of tracks (v.2). Mike postulates that this was done in the late 60's to early 70‚Äôs, as United Airline changed its corporate logo and marketing at this time*, a major rehab removed the Martin Denny tracks. He also mentions that these tracks would have been rather dated to people by that time as Martin Denny was also very well-known [4].

<aside>
üìù As an aside, it looks like United [changed their logo](https://1000logos.net/united-airlines-logo/) of ten years slightly in 1971, and again (more boldly) in 1974. Also, they ended their sponsorship of the Enchanted Tiki Room in 1975. Dole took over in 1976. It is possible that the loop did not change until the refurbishment that changed sponsors, which was also a possibility suggested by Mike [3].

</aside>

Now, I haven‚Äôt tried to follow up on this yet, but it does seem that Mike Cozart has a copy of this original reel. He provided some specific details in one of his posts [1] (lightly edited):

> The original, from a bi-directional 10" Tape-Athon reel track is timed at 80:30 (that is, 01:20:30) each direction. (Note: A Tape-Athon was a reel that would play one direction, and while it was basically rewinding, could play again and again‚Ä¶ This is how most of the parks area music was done for many years).  Original Tiki Background (80:30) bi-directional no date listed
> 

Mike does note that it is possible that this reel may have been from WDW, as apparently the WED guys would sometimes refer to Tropical Serenade as the "Tiki Room" [1]. However, djali999/Foxx over on the Passport to Dreams Old and New blog believes it‚Äôs fairly likely that the same waiting area loop played from 1971 to 1998 [5]. So, there is a very plausible chance that Mike‚Äôs reel is the correct loop for the Enchanted Tiki Room.

Finally, a quick search on ‚ÄúMartin Denny‚Äù + ‚ÄúDisneyland‚Äù revealed this gem: ‚ÄúSome time after the album was released I visited Disneyland,‚Äù says Denny. ‚ÄúI was waiting outside the Jungle Cruise and I heard this music that sounded vaguely familiar. Suddenly it dawned on me that they were playing ‚ÄòLotus Land.‚Äô Much to my amazement, that song was used by choreographers and even massage parlors.‚Äù [2]

So until we make contact with Mike to learn more about the specifics of the loop tracks, you can place a good bet that Lotus Land (from Martin Denny‚Äôs debut LP, ‚ÄúExotica‚Äù) was played, as well as several other tracks from his albums released before 1963.

# **Version 2: ca. 1976 - 2004**

The second version of the garden show music only contained a few short selections that had no bird calls and was much slower in tone; these were selected by Jack Wagner [1, 4]. It seems that by this point, the garden area was now called the lanai.

A reel transfer of this music can be heard in the Disneyland Collection torrent -- the track is labeled ‚ÄúPre-Show Back Ground Music‚Äù and runs 16:33.

A well-researched tracklist of this music was posted by TheTikiGod in 2018, with additional work done by Michael Sweeney.

# **Version 3: 2005 - Present**

The third, and current, installment of the Lanai loop was installed during the 2004-2005 refurbishment [3]. This listing was compiled over on Magic Music back in 2009 by C33, allthingsmustpass, MightyTriton, and others.

# **Bonus: Tahitian Terrace**

The Tahitian Terrance Restaurant did not share the same loop tracks of the Tiki Lanai and had its own music loop [3]. Evidence suggests that Mike ALSO has a copy of this loop (the luck!) as he gives more reel details in one of his posts:

> On 7 1/2 reels were:

Adventureland bridge w/birds
(9-71) I'M ASSUMING WDW
Tahitian Terrace BGM (7-20-73)

These reels were so deteriorated that they were rubbing off the playback heads and had to be removed. They were not masters, but play copies that had been retired.

Djali999/FoxxFur noted that the track ‚ÄúHawaiian Memories‚Äù by The Living Strings ‚Äúwas reused in the 1983 Polynesian Terrace loop at Tokyo Disneyland and, I've been told, the 1976 Tahitian Terrace loop at Disneyland‚Äù [6]. They also noted in another post that ‚Äúapparently the Polynesian Terrace loop is descended from the Disneyland Tahitian Terrace loop. I once spoke to a friend who knew a manager at the Tahitan Terrace who went over to TDL to open their Polynesian Terrace, and this manager apparently commented that ‚Äòover half‚Äô of music selections between the two loops was identical‚Äù [7].

The TDL Polynesian Terrace loop just so happens to be identical (at least in which tracks were used) to the Disneyland Hotel‚Äôs Tangaroa Terrace loop, which has been compiled by pixelated and StarWarsGalaxysEdge [8, 9].

Now to email Mike about those reels‚Ä¶
