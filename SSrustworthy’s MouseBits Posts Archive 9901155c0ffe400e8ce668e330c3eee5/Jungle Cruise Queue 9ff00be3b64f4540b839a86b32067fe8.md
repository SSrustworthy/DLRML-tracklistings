# Jungle Cruise Queue

Posted by Aubrey on 10/22/2022

Update - the loop source is actually available here on MouseBits in two separate torrents - "The Disneyland Collection" and "Jungle Cruise Boathouse loop." It is presumed to be source as an induction is rather difficult to obtain given the speaker setup in the queue. Some spectrogram analyses by pixelated and IHeartGaming suggest that the latter torrent has the better copy. The Disneyland Collection version suffers from compression. I verified the veracity of the loop by comparing it to a 15 minute queue recording posted on YouTube, and they lined up beautifully.

Thanks to these recordings, we can confirm that Deep Purple is by Benny Goodman, and NOT Turner Layton as I previously surmised.

When there are jungle sounds/radio interference, apparently the track “Taboo” by Arthur Lyman is mixed in with other SFX.

Link to the latter torrent:
