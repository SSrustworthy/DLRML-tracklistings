# Vintage Indian Village Tracks

*Posted by Aubrey on 2/26/23*

Some great sleuthing by RocketRodsXPR helped out with this ID:

On the recently uploaded “The Disneyland Collection” torrent, the track “ROA - Indian Village SFX 50s” audio is ID’d as 

1. Rabbit Dance - Benjamin Sitting Up, Lucy Randall, Paul High Horse, Oliver Standing Bear and Jonas Quiver - Music of the Sioux and the Navajo (track 1)
2. Spinning Dance - Julia Deal - Music of the Sioux and the Navajo (track 10)
<note, there are two tracks by the same name and artist on the album>
3. Spinning Dance - Julia Deal - Music of the Sioux and the Navajo (track 11)

These were also released on the 1949 album The Sioux And The Navajo.

The**"ROA - Indian Village SFX 1960 - 70"** track is the following track with dog SFX added:

1. Spinning Dance - Julia Deal - Music of the Sioux and the Navajo (track 10)

Unfortunately, we don’t know whether these are actually from the park or were an educated guess by the compiler of the Disneyland Collection. However, the fact that they were available in the 50’s is a good start.
