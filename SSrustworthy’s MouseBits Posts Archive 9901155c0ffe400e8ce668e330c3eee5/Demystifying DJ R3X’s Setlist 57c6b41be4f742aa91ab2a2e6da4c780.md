# Demystifying DJ R3X’s Setlist

*Posted by Aubrey on 11/05/22*

Over on the MouseCord Discord, elecTRONrabbit has done some fantastic sleuthing to uncover how long R3X’s set is over at Oga’s Cantina. He left a recorder in an inconspicuous location in Oga’s sometime in early 2020 and retrieved it after a little under seven hours. After creating a lengthy spreadsheet of notated music and R3X announcements (see references), he determined that there is no “set” loop time for R3X’s setlist, and that there is a certain degree of randomization in R3X’s announcements, reboots, and spoken introductions that occurs within the setlist.

**The loop consists of what I am defining as four “sub-loops” that join together to make a larger loop.** These sub-loops differ in primarily three aspects: 1) there may be a reboot that precedes the first track, or occurs sometime before the end of the sub-loop, thereby automatically starting the next sub-loop; 2) two tracks in defined positions will play different tracks across sub-loops; and 3) R3X’s announcements appear to be randomly pulled from a selection of comments preceding and following each track. These patterns are visible from elecTRONrabbit’s comprehensive spreadsheet.

Figure: A diagram of a typical “sub-loop” for DJ R3X’s playlist. Not pictured are R3X’s announcements connecting each track.

Note that as a result of the changing introductions before each track and changing timing of R3X’s reboots, there doesn’t seem to be a set loop time. However, elecTRONrabbit has noted that unknown track 1 is mid-play at the start of the recording, and does not play again until ~3 hours and 44 minutes later. From that point, the interchangeable tracks match the same order as they were played earlier. He also tried cutting the recording at that point and lined them up (one in left track, one in the right) and noted that while the songs that played are the same, R3X’s comments and how long he talks varies. For example, the setlist goes from Unknown 1 to "Oola Shuka," but R3X’s comments differ when introducing "Oola Shuka." As such, we can conclude that those comments (and reboots) are likely randomized, but it seems that the setlist itself does indeed loop. Also, elecTRONrabbit’s spreadsheet does not go into any detail about R3X’s mid-song comments.

# Intra-“sub-loop” patterns

Within a sub-loop, the vast majority of tracks were released on the official album, titled **Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge Oga’s Cantina: R3X’s Playlist #1**. In my diagram, I’ve labeled these tracks in blue. They play in order, with the intrusion of interchangeable tracks and the track “Overload.” One song released on the official album, Yocola Ateema, did not appear at all within elecTRONrabbit’s recording, even as an interchangeable track. **However, he and others have definitely heard it play at the cantina previously, so there may be additional information we are missing here.** None of the released tracks made appearances as interchangeable tracks.

The track “Overload” was not officially released, but was composed by the Brewhouse Music team and can be listed to in full on their site (labeled “REX - Opening Track”):

It’s referred to as “Overload” because R3X’s introduction to the track either says that he finds a loose wire, or he says “Okay folks, here’s a jam I made up myself. I call it, Overload!!!” and then launches into a rehash of his lines from his Star Tours piloting days.

# Identifying the interchangeable tracks

We exhausted several known tracks, both released and unreleased, in trying to identify the eight interchangeable tracks, and only ended up identifying three of the eight. I do not have samples of the unknown tracks, but they are apparently all very chill. They play in this order, which is the same across full loops (i.e., they will play at the same point in a track list in every full loop):

*<sub-loop 1>*

Unknown 1 **(Update, see bottom of this post)**

*<sub-loop 2>*

Unknown 2 **(Update, see bottom of this post)**

Unknown 3

*<sub-loop 3>*

Unknown 4 **(Update, see bottom of this post)**

Unknown 5 (Dubbed “Rasta-far-far-away-ian”; audible on WTTM24 Season 4 Episode #16)

*<sub-loop 4>*

# Additional unused tracks

Other tracks that were apparently created for Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge or the Sims game were checked as possibilities, but nothing matched. These include:

Additional tracks mentioned on Wookiepedia: Desert Skiff Sunset, Get Down, Lightyear, Bight Size, Pipa Tuba Braba

This is basically all we have. At some point I’ll try and uncover more information from pixelated’s BSO 401.72 Radio broadcast (partial live recording). Until then, let me know if you have any further info!

**Update:** Paul Barrie and co. discussed Yocola Ateema while in Oga's on WTTM24, and Yocola showed up after an  interchangeable track (Unknown 5; we call it Rasta-far-far-away-ian). They noted that it was the first time that they had heard Yocola Ateema and they previously thought it didn't play. They also mused that the "odd tracks" play on either side of Oola Shuka, which also matches our findings.

Unknown 4 is also audible at 20:13.

**Update 2 (11/12/22)**: ElecTRONrabbit checked his Oga’s recording, and some of the interchangeable tracks in this loop could be heard in a partial recording of the BSO 401.72 radio, referenced here: [BSO 401.72 Radio](BSO%20401%2072%20Radio%20ce26317261fb4eb8b4a2e010e75684d6.md). Namely, 

- Unknown 2 (Oga’s) = Unknown 1 (BSO 401.72)
- Unknown 4 (Oga’s) = Unknown 5 (BSO 401.72)
- Unknown 1 (Oga’s) = Unknown 10 (BSO 401.72)

I uploaded live recordings of all of these tracks (thanks to pixelated’s recording!) on the aforementioned BSO 401.72 radio post.
