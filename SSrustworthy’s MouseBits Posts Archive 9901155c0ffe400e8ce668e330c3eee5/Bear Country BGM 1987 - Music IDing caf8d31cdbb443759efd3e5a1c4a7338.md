# Bear Country BGM 1987 - Music IDing

*Posted by Aubrey on 09/29/2022*

I was looking at some bear country home videos a while back, and I found this one from 1987 that features two snippets of music towards the end of the video that appear to be Bear Country BGM:

The song snippets recorded in the home video can be downloaded here:

I was able to ID one of the tracks as "**Nut Sundae**" by Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed from the album Me And Jerry (1970). There's a section of the song that is either edited out of the BGM or of the video, as the snippet jumps from the middle to the end of the song.

The other track is one that I only have a 16-second snippet of, and it seems like it repeats. It sounds an awful lot like a Chet Atkins creation, but no music ID service has been successful at finding the source thus far. I'd love for somebody to figure it out.

There's a chance that this music is related to the Golden Bear Lodge BGM, referenced in this post:
