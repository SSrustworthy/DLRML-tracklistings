# DL Park Trip Recordings & Observations - January 2023

*Posted by Aubrey on 1/21/23*

Hi all! I visited Disneyland Park on Tuesday, January 3rd and (mostly) enjoyed a very rainy day taking a few recordings around the park with the help of StarWarsGalaxysEdge. And by rainy, I mean it did not let up, ever. I am presenting those recordings here for reference, although note that they are all live recordings and there’s but a handful. Every once in a while my voice might pop up  briefly as I said hello to cast members, characters, or out of some other necessity (sorry).

This trip took place during the holiday celebrations, so the typical BGM was replaced with Christmas versions where expected.

# Notes on my park observations:

## Downtown Disney

- In the morning, the holiday esplanade loop was audible: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C566GZ6-EI4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C566GZ6-EI4)
- In the evening, there was a holiday nighttime loop: [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0HBAppsCDBq2HsAdwbW0hx?si=c3ffcfd0a0b74102&nd=1](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0HBAppsCDBq2HsAdwbW0hx?si=c3ffcfd0a0b74102&nd=1)
- I went into the World of Disney in the evening, which apparently was playing the Backlot Premiere Shop Holiday Loop (from when the parks were closed for COVID-19). I don’t have a track listing but the loop includes music from the likes of Lindsey Stirling (violin instrumentals), Ariana Grande singing "Last Christmas", “Light of Christmas” by Owl City and TobyMac.

## Main Street, USA

- The general MSUSA loop was the Christmas loop. None of the songs seemed out of the norm whenever I could hear it.
- I stopped for quite a bit in the Disneyana gallery to see if there was a loop, and there was! I recorded the full loop with some cast members chattering in the background from time to time. The loop is essentially an audio tour of Disneyland and consists mostly of selections from the AMHOD 50th box set. I found out with the help of RocketRodsXPR (and his very helpful son) that this loop is apparently the same or very similar to the loop that played for Disneyland’s 50th inside the MSUSA cinema. The loop was audible in all of the three rooms (front, middle, back) but somewhat quieter in the middle. I couldn’t tell if there were clear speakers in the middle room or not. I don’t have a track listing quite yet, but will post one soon.
- I stopped in the Disney Clothiers Ltd. shop and some light strings were audible. pixelated let me know that this loop has been the same as the one used in the Emporium at DLP (see wedroy1923’s track listing [here](https://disney-parks-music-compendium.blogspot.com/2022/11/disney-clothiers-bgm.html)). I grabbed a few minutes of recording, but it was hard to hear and I figured that we had the track listing already from a DLP loop (we did). It’s most audible standing underneath the (few) speakers in the ceiling.
- I had not previously been in the Plaza Point - Holiday & Ornaments Store in the former location of the Kodak store, but it was cute. The loop has been faithfully reconstructed by Magical Soundtracks based on a reference recording, and can be listened to on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0aGtEuqZUw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0aGtEuqZUw). It’s a lot of I Salonisti and Palm Court Theatre Orchestra, a la Paradise Garden Park, BVS and Boardwalk Pizza & Pasta BGM. There had been some whisperings as to whether the loop changed for the holidays, but I shazamed “Belle of the Ball - Schwanen Salon Orchestra” which is part of the regular loop, so I believe it stayed the same.
- Main Street Cinema seemed to have the same old loop (there’s a live recording and the original CD over in the torrents, in separate torrents). I grabbed a partial recording.
- I didn’t stop to listen, but the Plaza Inn exterior was playing upbeat Disney music in the morning for the **Minnie & Friends Breakfast in the Park** character breakfast. It sounded very similar to the Magical Express sort of music. This vlogger’s video has the live music loop in the background: [https://youtu.be/OF6Ce1Fwt_k?t=638](https://youtu.be/OF6Ce1Fwt_k?t=638) It does seem to be different from the loop that was posted by DisneyChris in **[Re: Disneyland Plaza Inn Character Breakfast Loop](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=7994.msg71851#msg71851).**
- I did not stop in the Emporium, but I would have expected it to play the DLP Arcade loop (Joplin ragtime), as previously identified by others on the forum.
- I recorded some of the Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln instrumental Preshow music (played before the preshow presentation begins). I haven’t lined it up yet but I think it’s included on the World’s Fair box set.
- The entrance to the Opera House has been showing a Haunted Mansion exhibit for some time now. I made a recording of the very brief loop (<6 minutes) which plays a chronological assortment of tracks: Foyer organ (with creaks and corridor of doors SFX), Madame Leota seance chants (with backing music and SFX), ballroom organ (with SFX), and graveyard instrumental track (delineated as Graveyard Base Music - Enhanced in the HM Unofficial 34th soundtrack in the torrents).
- The 1890 party line is still in the Market house, at the start of the line for the Starbucks.
- There was a list of Christmas tunes on rotation for the Candy Palace Wurlitzer. In order, these were “Christmas in Candyland,” “Deck the Halls,” “Frosty the Snowman,” “Hark the Herald Angels Sing,” “Jingle Bells and Here Comes Santa Clause,” “Jingle Bell Rock,” “Rudolph the Red Nose reindeer [sic]” “Santa Clause is Coming to Town” and “We Wish You a Merry Christmas.”

## Adventureland

- The new Jungle Cruise radio (previously noted as new skipper but same music selections in the same order) was audible from the walkway, but I did not stop to listen.
- Indiana Jones Adventure’s queue music was as groovy (and the same) as ever.
- Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room Lanai music seemed unchanged.
- I didn’t get a chance to stop at the Tropical Hideaway, but I’ve posted pixelated’s track listings elsewhere on the forum. There’s also a great new podcast that aims to record sounds at the parks, and [they have a good 3/4 of the daytime loop recorded](https://park-sensory.simplecast.com/episodes/tropical-hideaway-daytime-bgm-loop). Otherwise please reference the post here on the forums for the daytime/nighttime loop track listings (courtesy of pixelated and Magical Soundtracks).
- There is no BGM at the Adventureland Bazaar/South Seas Traders (nor has there ever been in my knowledge).

## Frontierland

- The Frontierland holiday loop seemed to be the same as usual. It played throughout the land as well as in the Golden Horseshoe interior.
- There was a special holiday video loop in Pioneer Mercantile, and yes, I recorded all of it (and waited for it to end, fervently as I stood in the same spot for ~45 min). It was a very generic Disney holiday loop with few “Frontier” tie-ins, if any. I will create a track listing in the near future. I know that a new general loop was introduced in September-ish of 2022, but I still haven’t figured out what that one consists of.
- Mark Twain Queue - I’ll post more about this on the other thread, but basically I sat there for 45 minutes getting the Wurlitzer loop and I forgot to turn on the directional mic once I got it out 2.5 minutes into the recording. Ugh. I had nightmares about this for several days. At least I got to listen to it in person! I had to ask the CM at the entrance to play it for me, and he graciously turned it on.
- TSI was closed, but I was wanting to go check out a loop that apparently plays at Lafitte’s Landing.

## New Orleans Square

- Rivers of America waterfront loop sounded the same as it has been in previous years. From my notes: "This loop played in the Blue Bayou Restaurant and on the Riverfront of the Rivers of America. It is apparently identical to the Tokyo Disneyland Royal Street loop. Its earliest sighting was in 2011. See MouseBits: **[Re: Disneyland Resort Christmas Loops 2.0](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=6912.msg58625#msg58625), [Blue Bayou Holiday BGM](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9114.msg86662#msg86662),** and **[New Holiday Loop in NOS](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9141.msg86828#msg86828)**”
- Haunted Mansion Holiday loop was the same old Ghostly Music Box / Phantom Manor Music Box loop.
- POTC queue was the same old Pirates Overture.
- I finally got a chance to check out the Port Royal BGM. It is just two tracks - the graveyard instrumental track (~00:58) (delineated as “Graveyard Base Music - Enhanced” in the HM Unofficial 34th soundtrack in the torrents) and the “End Credits” - From “The Nightmare Before Christmas” (~01:33). I posted about this in **[Re: Port Royal loop (?)](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9027.msg99145#msg99145)**
- I stepped inside Tiana’s boutique, but didn’t make a recording as Magical Soundtracks released an accurate reconstruction within a few days of my visit. Apparently it’s a long one, too… ~1 hr 45 min.
- None of the other shops had BGM besides these two.
- I didn’t listen closely but the French Market seemed to be playing the same holiday loop as in previous years.

## Critter Country

- Splash Mountain BGM was loud and clear.
- No holiday music to be had, just the same old Pooh BGM.
- Pooh’s Corner does not have any BGM.

## Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge

- Transition music is audible at the edge of the land: [https://soundcloud.com/adam-michalak-1/star-wars-galaxys-edge-entrance-theme](https://soundcloud.com/adam-michalak-1/star-wars-galaxys-edge-entrance-theme)
- BSO radio was playing loud and clear outside of Ronto Roasters; Huzzah! I did a three hour pickup recording, then realized that the directional mic had to be turned on, and so I did another one. I’ll be posting more about this in another post. My recording is included in the dropbox; however, pixelated also did some recordings a few weeks after mine that are better quality/more audible and was kind enough to share them in the Discord.

## Fantasyland

- I stood underneath the Castle Drawbridge area to catch the brief “When You Wish Upon a Star Loop” for edit points. They only loop a short portion of the song. I’ll post those points later.
- Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique - I had been wanting to check out whether they updated the loop, and I can confirm that they did. Unfortunately, it’s a rather cramped space for people to just stand around, and it was getting slightly awkward so I left probably halfway through the loop. I will post about my findings later.
- I was hoping to grab the Alice in Wonderland attraction BGM (~20 min long) but it was down for the day and the BGM was shut off.
- General Fantasyland Carousel and Fantasyland BGM music were playing as usual.
- I was hoping to get a recording of the Mad Hatter jshop loop, but I headed over there later in the day, and a lot of people were inside due to the rain so it was nearly inaudible. I only caught “AEIOU,” which had been ID’d already as the first track in the partial track listing, so I headed out.
- Red Rose Taverne seemed to be playing custom arrangements of the BATB soundtrack. Upon further inquiry it is apparent that the loop might be the same as that created for Gaston’s Tavern in New Fantasyland at WDW. While I was unable to verify this, the track listing for that loop is as follows (thanks to ebbelein and monorail91):
    - 01. Maison des Lunes (2:16)
    - 02. Something There (2:21)
    - 03. Belle (4:39)
    - 04. Gaston (2:18)
    - 05. Me (2:35)
    - 06. Human Again (4:16)
    - 07. To the Fair (1:51)
    - 08. Beauty and the Beast (1:44)
    - 09. Gaston (3:06)
    - 10. Be Our Guest (5:09)
- I didn’t really check out any other land bgm (for specific rides or otherwise).

Tomorrowland

- The general Tomorrowland BGM was fairly quiet except for the old PeopleMover track at the entrance.
- The Space Mountain Concourse loop was not audible. Along the queue, you could only head the Com Chat in very small areas. There was nothing playing in the renovated arcade portion of the queue.
- I went into Star Traders and recorded for a few minutes, but again, it was crazy loud and busy so I had to resign any hopes of recording the full loop. It was playing Star Wars themes, but I have no clue if it was the re-recorded themes (a la Star Wars Launch Bay) or the soundtrack arrangements.
- I was passing by the Tomorrowland Terrace late at night and noticed that the Disney Springs version of “When Will My Life Begin” was playing. StarWarsGalaxysEdge has mentioned that the Terrace plays the Disney Springs Marketplace loop between shows, although I didn’t catch if there was a certain time of day at which it played.
- I didn’t go out of my way to check out anything else (for example, the Autopia BGM, which I ID’d recently)
