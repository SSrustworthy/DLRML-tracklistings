# Matterhorn Extended Queue

*Posted by Aubrey on 10/21/2022*

After seeing StarWarsGalaxysEdge's comment about a possible other track, I went ahead and made a proper track listing for the loop. I lined two iterations of the loop from their recording next to each other and marked track times using a spectrogram. I concur with StarWarsGalaxysEdge that the loop effects seem to be mixed in separately and on top of the music.

All tracks seem to be available to stream or purchase on Amazon, itunes, Spotify etc. They shouldn't be too hard to find with a quick search. I left off albums for tracks found on multiple compilations. I didn't line up tracks with their source tracks, but comparing tracks to their listed source track times (they are all on compilations or were only released on one album) all tracks but one were shorter than their source track by 5 seconds or less. The one exception was Pariampampam (Live), which was shorter by about 10 seconds, for which the end was trimmed to remove the applause.

I assigned the start of the loop to Bi d'r Huet. Theres a ~1 second section with no music, only SFX.
