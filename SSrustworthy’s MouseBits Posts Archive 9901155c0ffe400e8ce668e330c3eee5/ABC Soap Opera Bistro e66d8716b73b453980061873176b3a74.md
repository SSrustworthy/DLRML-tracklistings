# ABC Soap Opera Bistro

*Posted by Aubrey on 10/10/2022*

The only new track I am adding here that wasn't mentioned previously is track 5. Everything else to me indeed sounds like scene music and nothing turned up from various music ID apps. I'm going to try to reach out to RC Cates, who apparently was a composer for both "Port Charles" and "General Hospital" in the time period that the restaurant was open, to see if we can get some more info on these cues.

I verified that this loop played throughout the whole restaurant from this video. Track 12 starts playing at the 5:40 mark, clearly followed by track 13 and track 14.

Note - on Unknown A, I came across something pretty similar that played in an episode of Port Charles, very briefly. Don't worry, I didn't watch the full episode...

Approximate loop length: 00:52:13.967

*This is inaccurate, as several tracks were cut off due to the "internet radio" playing other tracks in-between some of these with fade-ins. However, it can be said that the loop is at least this long.*
