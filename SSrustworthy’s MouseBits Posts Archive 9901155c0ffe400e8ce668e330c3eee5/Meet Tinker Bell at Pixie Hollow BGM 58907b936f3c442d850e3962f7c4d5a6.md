# Meet Tinker Bell at Pixie Hollow BGM

*Posted by Aubrey on 2/1/2023*

According to what I think is 772pilot’s original induction, I have recreated the Pixie Hollow BGM almost in full. The thing is, all but four of the tracks were included on the Tinker Bell Special Edition soundtrack featuring Joel McNeely’s score as released by Intrada in 2013. The original movie was released in 2008 and a mostly-vocal soundtrack was released at that time. Since Pixie Hollow opened on October 25, 2008, this was before the release of the Intrada score soundtrack, so the loop’s creator was probably working with all the score cues, hence the lack of a few on the soundtrack.

The Intrada album is available here: [https://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.8196/.f](https://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.8196/.f)
The resourceful can find it on SquidBoard (but not on the main Disney thread).

The tracks were compiled apparently in chronological order as they appeared in the movie. Some of the tracks were also released as in-game music in Disneyland Adventures (although none of the unreleased score cues, sadly).

There are generally very small crossfades between edited tracks.
