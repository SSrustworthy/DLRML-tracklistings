# DCA — Francis’ Ladybug Boogie

*Posted by Aubrey on 09/28/2022*

Hey all,

I don't think anyone realized this (or more likely, even cared) but the music that played at Francis' Ladybug Boogie in "it's a bug's land" at DCA was all needledrop. I watched dozens of videos on Youtube, and eventually came to the conclusion that the tracks that played there were as follows:

James Session

Avenue C

Shout And Feel It

Two O’clock Jump

Bugle Call Rag

*These all come from the same album:*

One O'clock Boogie, Two O'clock Jump - Tom Cunningham Orchestra (2000)

I'm not sure what order these played in. There is a chance that there are more, but I watched a lot of videos and the same songs were repeated over and over again. I think that they played constantly, unlike the Tuck and Roll buggies where the music only played while the attraction was in motion.
