# Ariel’s Grotto restaurant - DCA

*Posted by Aubrey on 4/20/23*

Using the first five minutes of this live video [1], I’ve been able to ID the music from the Ariel’s Grotto restaurant formerly located in Paradise Pier. The video has several cuts which contain music from the exterior Tokyo DisneySea Mermaid Lagoon BGM. Apparently “the music in there always used to be turned way, way down to the point you couldn't hear it” [2, 3].

The full TDS loop is available on YouTube [4]. I lined all snippets with the source loop in a DAW. There was some previous discussion on this specific video on MouseBits [5].

TheBeets also posted an induction recording, which runs slightly shorter than the video (29:52) [6].

About five minutes of the BGM was released previously as “Mermaid Lagoon Overture” on a Tokyo DisneySea official album [7]. However, the entire BGM runs ~34 minutes and the official release cuts it short at ~5 minutes. The loop feels very repetitive as only a few motifs and an interlude are mixed several times with slight differences in instrumentation, tempo, etc.
