# Bountiful Valley Farms / Farmer’s Market

We still do not seem to have a reference recording for this loop, but my best guess for tracks 6 and 12 based on the overall feel of the loop and the provided track times on are as follows:

**6. Black Mountain Rag** - Doc Watson, Merle Watson - Doc & Merle Watson’s Guitar Album (Flying Fish, 1983)

*Running time listed on Kristen's site is 2:41, and the album track is 2:37*

**12. Freight Train** - Merle Travis, Joe Maphis - Country Guitar Giants (CMH Records, 1979)

*Running time listed on Kristen's site is 2:32, and the album track is 2:29*

Unfortunately, no way to know for sure unless a reference pops up. However, Joe Maphis does show up elsewhere on the loop, so that's something.
