# NOS 1994 Night and Day Loops [Unverified]

Posted by Aubrey on 1/22/2023

I recently got in touch with Jason the Archivist (archivistjason on Twitter, or ‚ÄúProgressland‚Äù on the Magic Music forums), who had once mentioned ‚Äúmid-90‚Äôs NOS loops‚Äù on Magic Music [1]. I was intrigued by what this meant, and he clarified that he had recieved these loops from an ex-WDI source in 2000.

The loops he sent are here:

Seeing as I found a live recording at Disneyland in 1996 where the Royal Street Bachelors‚Äô 93 loop was playing [2], I‚Äôm not sure if this set of loops did actually play in the park at all, or whether it did but only for a short time. This is why I put the [Unverified] tag in the title.

As you‚Äôll see from the track listings, these loops are very similar and have several overlapping tracks. Overall, I do think the day loop has a brighter, livelier feel compared to the night loop, even with the similarities in tracks.

Since I am providing the tracks themselves with this post, and the loops are unverified, I am not delineating details on track length, edit points, etc. If anyone wants me to post the REAPER project files, let me know!
