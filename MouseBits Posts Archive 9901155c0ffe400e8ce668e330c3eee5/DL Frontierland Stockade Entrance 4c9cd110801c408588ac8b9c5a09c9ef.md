# DL Frontierland Stockade Entrance

*Posted by Aubrey on 09/24/2022*

In this post, I’ll try to put together what has been previously unearthed about the music that has played from the Disneyland Frontierland Stockade.

There appear to be a few different forms of the loop:

1. 1955 - ca. 1975: No music (likely)

2. ca. 1975 - 1992: Stockade Loop v.1

3. ca. 1992 - 2012: Stockade Loop v.2

4. 2012 - Present Day: General Frontierland loop (introduced in 2012)

# **Stockade Loop v.1**

This loop has been cited in a few different places [1, 2] as being composed of a single song:

1. Western Saloon - Ib Glindemann (composer) - Capitol Hi-”Q” Reel X-75

This track was released as part of the Capitol Records Hi-”Q” production music line as track 3 on reel X-75 [1, 2]. There’s a chance that it was later re-released on Media Music release MEDS-4, but I haven’t verified that yet. This song was apparently re-recorded by a Disney studio musician as on-board music for the Mark Twain that played between narration snippets, at a slower pace [3]. This song is included in DisneyChris’ “A Day at Disneyland” torrent, and can be listened to on YouTube:

# **Stockade Loop v.2**

There are a few conflicting reports on this loop, as it only played out of one or two speakers and was pretty quiet [1, 4]. I don’t know of any reference recordings floating around, so we have to rely on what was previously reported (sidenote: if recordings were allowed to be shared on Magic Music, I think we would have a lot more figured out…).

This loop was initially reported as being about five songs with banjo, fife, and drum instrumentation, and lasted around 7 minutes as all the tracks are relatively short [4, 8]. Several sources have reported these tracks as originating from the complete soundtrack of Ken Burns’ Civil War documentary, apparently purchased by Eddie Sotto in the 90’s [8]. As the tracks listed below also appear in some form on the shorter, commercially available soundtrack, it is supposed that they are indeed from the commercial soundtrack and not the unreleased portion of the soundtrack, but this is unconfirmed.

There have been specific reports of hearing “When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again” [4], “Battle Cry of Freedom” [5, 8]. Turnstle reported that the only track that they recognized from the Civil War soundtrack as having played at the Stockade was the “Drums of War”, but they did not detail what sort of a recording they were referencing [5].

The loop disappeared when the 2012 Frontierland loop was installed [5].

This initial track listing was posted on Magic Music and the Disney Music Loops site [3, 6].

1. Drums of War

2. Battle Cry of Freedom

3. Unknown (denoted as Song #2)

4. When Johnny Comes Marching Home

5. Battle Cry of Freedom

6. Kingdom Coming

This secondary, and more likely correct, track listing was later posted on MouseBits [5].

1. Drums of War

2. Battle Cry of Freedom

3. When Johnny Comes Marching Home

4. Marching Through Georgia

5. Lorena

6. Kingdom Coming

From comparing these two listings, tracks 1, 2, and 6 are cohesive with each other. Furthermore, “When Johnny Comes Marching Home” appears on both of the lists. The biggest difference is the ordering of tracks 3, 4, and 6, and the dispute that Battle Cry of Freedom played twice. While there are two different versions listed on the official soundtrack, both are piano-based and don’t quite fit the feel of Frontierland, and so it is more likely that the version from the “A Musical History of Disneyland” was used here instead. It is also possible that the DML listing's second Battle Cry was mistaken for the slower-sounding Lorena, which sounds maybe-kinda similar in some of the chord progression. Therefore I would pin the MouseBits track listing as more likely to be correct.

Either way, this is what I’ve been able to scrounge up. Please speak up if you have anything further to contribute!

UPDATE 4/20/23

It's a long story, but I have it directly from a Disney lawyer that "Kingdom Coming" was from Ed Sweeney's album, rather than the Civil War series. It is under the title of The Year of Jubilo. And confirmed that "Battle Cry of Freedom" was from Ed as well. So the updated tracklist is as follows:

Frontierland Stockade Entrance v.2 ca. 1992-2012
Loop length ~6:00

1. Drums of War - The Old Bethpage Brass Band - The Civil War
2. Battle Cry of Freedom - Ed Sweeney - American Sample OR Passing Through OR A Musical History of Disneyland
3. When Johnny Comes Marching Home - The Old Bethpage Brass Band - The Civil War
4. Marching Through Georgia - Jay Ungar, Matt Glaser, Molly Mason, Peter Amidon - The Civil War
5. Lorena - Jay Ungar, Matt Glaser, Molly Mason - The Civil War
6. The Year of Jubilo (Kingdom Coming) - Ed Sweeney - American Sampler OR Passing Through

American Sampler was the album used at the time for Ed's tracks, but is now out of print. The tracks were rereleased on Passing Through. You can buy the album or individual tracks on Ed's website:
