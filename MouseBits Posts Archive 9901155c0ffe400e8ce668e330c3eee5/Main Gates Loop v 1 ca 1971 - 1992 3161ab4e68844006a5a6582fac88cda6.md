# Main Gates Loop v.1: ca. 1971 - 1992

*Posted by Aubrey on 09/24/2022*

Although this topic is 10 years old, I think it's worth adding some notes here on the loop. After C33 posted his samples, nobody bothered to actually write out a final track list! So here we are.

Pixelated kindly dug up those samples from the archives for me, but I don't have a reference recording, so **I am only listing the order of play and not the edits**. DisneyChris has posted a recreation on YouTube/his site, which I am linking below. He does claim that he has used a reference recording to make his, so I would refer to that if you want edit points as some of the medleys are indeed cut up. Also important to note is that track 1/15, 4/18, 6/24, and 9/29 are repeats.

Some great discussion of the original WDW Entrance loop (which is similar but not identical) can be found here:

Update 4/18/23: I’ve been able to reconstruct this loop based on the Disneyland Collection loop, labeled ‘Main Entrance Music Loop (1971-1992). The recording starts at Disney Medley #1 (track 24) of the compiled tracklist. The playback rates are all over the place for the different tracks. Additional clarifications are added in red. As the records themselves are not readily available, I used various sources from my reconstruction:

Tracks from The Disneyland Band LP were sourced from Rick Conant’s cleaned rip posted to YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fY5TpM2UE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_fY5TpM2UE)

Hi-Fi Music For Children: From 2 to 92 can be purchased from a third party site, Daddy Kool Records. It is available digitally a few countries (I saw Spain and possibly Zimbabwe?) but it was a minor headache trying to figure that out, so the third party route was most ideal: [https://daddykool.com/UPC/5055396213218](https://daddykool.com/UPC/5055396213218)

March Along with Mary Poppins was uploaded to YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmZ46vJ0KqX5k_LMdx0K5vxwQ4GmAfTYf](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmZ46vJ0KqX5k_LMdx0K5vxwQ4GmAfTYf)

Pinocchio Motion Picture Soundtrack - I used the Legacy Collection edition, which went slightly out of sync for one portion. The edits I used were 3:36.226-5:43.233 for that source track.

I found the Frank Chacksfield Orchestra tracks on YouTube.
