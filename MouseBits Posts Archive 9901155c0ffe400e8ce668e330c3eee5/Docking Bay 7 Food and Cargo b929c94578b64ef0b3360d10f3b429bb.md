# Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo

*Posted by Aubrey on 4/4/23*

pixelated has shared a live recording of the loop at Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo at Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge at the Disneyland park. This loop is comprised of custom musical compositions by Randy Kerber and Harlan Hodges. Released samples (44 seconds to a minute long) of their compositions are available on Harlan Hodges’ website.

Three of their compositions have also been released in full as part of the soundtrack to the Sims 4 game expansion pack, Journey to Batuu. These are Marketplace, Marketplace Hora, and Mischievous. Instructions to extract the soundtrack elements are here:

My compiled tracklist is below, with track times measured from the first beat of a track to the next track start. I have not managed to identify the location of Dark Caravan or Quicksand in the loop (which are samples from Hodges’ website). I started the loop at 1:55.766 in pixelated’s recording.
