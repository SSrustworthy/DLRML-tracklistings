I stopped for a brief moment to capture this loop for the sake of edit points. It is not the whole song, and is rather short.

**Sleeping Beauty Castle Drawbridge**

Loop length 00:01:00.923

1. When You Wish Upon A Star - Cliff Edwards (edited 0:26.292 to 1:27.214; note: small fade in and out)

I used the version on "A Musical History of Disneyland" box set. The loop seems to be a half a second or so faster than the source track after the chorus begins.
