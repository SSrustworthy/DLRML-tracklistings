# Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique

*Posted by Aubrey on 3/20/23*

I went to check out the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique loop in January, which at some point changed from the original loop (which was lifted from Once Upon A Time… A Princess Boutique). Karalora talked about the original loop quite a bit on her blog:

This iteration of the loop seems to be a bunch of new princess movie song additions inserted into the former loop.

The first few songs that I heard didn’t get recorded. I based this list off of some quick notes I took after I realized as much. Essentially, “Let It Go” was played before four songs that were in the previous iteration of the loop:

1. Let It Go - Frozen

2. Be Our Guest - Beauty and the Beast

3. Someday My Prince Will Come - Snow White and the Seven Dwarves

4. Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo - Cinderella

5. Finale - Sleeping Beauty

These are the songs that I’ve ID’d based on my partial loop recording from January. The first and last tracks were only partially recorded. The edits are just some truncations at the beginning and end of the tracks. Apologies for some artifacts in the recording. It is worst on the left channel.
