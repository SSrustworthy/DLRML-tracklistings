# Mickey’s Toontown v.2 Loop (April 2013)

*Posted by Aubrey on 4/4/23*

Unbeknownst or unrealized to many of us, the area music in Mickey’s Toontown changed in April 2013 to a new loop with several pieces from the previous loop retained. Some new arrangements of  themes from older shorts were included, potentially in an effort to include more of the music featured in the Have a Laugh! segments from Disney Channel.

The following tracklist was compiled based on a distorted induction recording by pixelated. New themes were identified by StarOrion on their website. This loop apparently also plays at Tokyo Disneyland's Toontown.
