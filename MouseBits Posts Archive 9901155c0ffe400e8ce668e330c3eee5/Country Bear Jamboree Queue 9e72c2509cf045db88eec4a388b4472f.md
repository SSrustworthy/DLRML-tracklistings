# Country Bear Jamboree Queue

*Posted by Aubrey on 09/08/2022*

Does anyone have any information about the track list for the CBJ queue at Disneyland? I am sure that music from the WDW LP or at least from the same recording session was played. I have only been able to pick out the tracks "Bearless Love" followed by "Wabash Cannonball" from this video of the queue (Most videos don't involve the queue, as it closed in 2001 and nobody presumably wanted to waste tape on it...):

That's technically in the same order as the music that plays at the Hungry Bear Restaurant, according to Pixelated:

Also, this was posted on WaltsMusic as the area music for the Mile Long Bar. It's not the same track listing as the HBR.
