The current BGM for the exhibit is a single track.

**The Disney Gallery - Disney 100 Years of Wonder**

Loop length 00:04:29.946
1. When You Wish Upon A Star - Stan Whitmire - Piano Inspirations: Uplifting Songs On Solo Piano
<note: edited 0:00.225 to 4:30.171 to remove silence at beginning and end>

Using StarWarsGalaxysEdgeâ€™s reference, there is 01:11 of the source track that was not captured in the reference recording, but I doubt that there are any edits.  There is likely a small fade out at the end to truncate the ringing final note.
