# Submarine Voyage Queue Loop

Posted by Aubrey on 10/22/2022

Hi all! If you haven't had a chance to check out the Disneyland Collection torrent yet, definitely go take a look!

The collection just so happens to have 4 live recordings of the Submarine Voyage queue at Disneyland. I believe that these comprise the full queue, as the narration featured aligns with that from the WDW queue (with references to the 20k Leagues Under the Sea movie removed, and more of a "Tomorrowland/Future" focus, with references to medicine and space travel.  For reference, the WDW narration was written out here: [https://waltdatedworld.com/id40.htm](https://waltdatedworld.com/id40.htm)

No full queue list for Disneyland's Submarine Voyage attraction had been compiled previously (although there were some efforts on the Magic Music forums). Comparing these recordings to the WDW listing on Duckzz' 2019 blog, the tracks appear to be the same (an exception is that Oh Johnny Come to Hilo is ordered differently.)

The tracks that appeared in this queue loop are not those that were composed for EDL/DLP's Pirate Cove. Apparently those were used in the WDW queue to create a v.2 of their loop, but that did not happen at Disneyland. Also, as an aside, the S.S. Columbia instrumental tracks that appeared on Disneyland Forever were from Pirate Cove as well. The tunes that overlap with the 20k tracks released on WDW Forever are noticeably longer, have different intros, and slightly different (fuller) instrumentation.

Several of the correct tracks that were used here are unreleased, although some people may have them as Columbia Harbour House BGM from Liberty Square. Of these, I only have the four that were released on WDW Forever: "Whale of A Tale," "Drunken Sailor," "Sailing, Sailing," and "Sailor's Hornpipe." Anybody that has the others - feel free to share!

The below tracks are typed out with the queue narration that appeared with them. RocketRodsXPR posted his transcription on the below thread, but I've provided some slight corrections. I have four separate recordings, which I assume are chronological, but there's no overlap between them so it's difficult to tell exactly. As mentioned previously, these tracks are largely in the same order as Duckzz' WDW queue listing.

# **Submarine Voyage thru Liquid Space Queue Loop (1976 - 1998)**

## **Queue A**

1. The Sailor Likes His Bottle, Oh

*If there are intelligent beings on other planets, and if they see our planet as our astronauts observed it on their journey to the moon, they might very well have a different name for it. Perhaps 'Oceanus' would be more appropriate.  For they can see the vast areas of water that cover over 70 percent of the surface of this oasis in space. Today, this uncapped region of the earth presents a new and compelling challenge.*

2. A-roving (started during previous narration)

*If man is to reap the bounty of the deep, he must learn all he can about the ocean and its contents. To this end, marine laboratories throughout the world are stepping up their research capabilities. Sophisticated diving methods have been developed. Saturation diving techniques have dramatically increased the time man can live comfortably for long periods in the ocean's depths.  It seems safe to assume that the same technology that freed earth-bound man to journey into outer space will one day release him from his terrestrial bonds and permit him absolute freedom in liquid space.*

3. Sailor's Hornpipe (started during previous narration)

*As you cruise beneath the waters of this Disneyland submarine adventure, consider the many things that we have yet to learn about this boundless realm of liquid space.*

## **Queue B**

1. Oh Johnny Come to Hilo

*Modern man's most compelling interests in the ocean lies in its great potential for renewable resources.  Not only of protein-rich food, but also in the wealth of minerals, energy, and drugs. Recent explorations have revealed vast deposits of minerals that can be mined, including the intriguing manganese nodules that literally litter the ocean floor. Man is learning to harness the restless energy stored in the sea. Already he has tapped the ebb and flow of the tide to produce clean and efficient electric power. One of the most promising areas of investigation is in the field of marine biomedicine. There's little doubt that scientists will discover many antibiotics and other useful drugs in ocean organisms. Some marine drugs that show promise are powerful painkillers and muscle relaxants found in the puffer fishes, anti-bacteria and anti-viral toxins produced by the sea cucumbers, virus-killing extracts found in bivalve mollusks, and many, many others. These are but a few of the potentialities to be found in the world's last frontier. But we must always keep in mind: the bounty of the sea is not limitless. Man must be prudent in his exploration and utilization of this last, great storehouse of natural wealth.*

2. Sailing, Sailing

## **Queue C**

1. Drunken Sailor

*How old is the Earth?  How was it formed? Are the oceans and continents permanent features? These, and other questions about our watery planet, have intrigued man since the beginning of time. As far as we know, the oceans have existed for some four and a half billion years. And, for about the last one hundred million years, the sea has been a living, dynamic world, a cosmos of creative forces, shaping and reshaping continents, spewing up islands with fiery ruptures. Geologically speaking, mountains have been raised, and then worn away by falling and running water, the debris carried off the lowlands, and then back to the sea. This cycle has focused attention on the oceans for the answer to these ageless questions. Men of science believe that the sediments below the waves contain a continuous record of terrestrial history. And so they have begun to probe the ocean floor.*

2. A Long Time Ago

## **Queue D**

1. A Whale of a Tale

*To primitive man, the oceans were merely a source of fear, fascination, and fish. About three millenniums ago, the seas became a highway over which to carry national power and culture, as well as trade. The story of civilization is largely the story of seafaring men who quested for ever-farther shores. They saw the ocean as a wilderness and a challenge. They used the sea, but only on its terms. Today, the challenge continues, but now modern man appears to be on the verge of taming the restless sea.*

2. 'Round the Corner, Sally (started during previous narration)

*We hope the undersea voyage you are about to take will stimulate your interest in the phenomenon of life in the sea.*
