# NOS - Port Royal Loop

*Posted by Aubrey on 1/21/23*

Just checked out the loop on my visit this month. In its current form, it's only two songs.

**New Orleans Square - Port Royal BGM**

Loop length ~00:02:35.996

1. Haunted Mansion, â€˜Graveyard Musicâ€™ - Disneyland Forever (loop length 00:59.883)

<note, crossfade out at 0:59.336>

2.Â  End Credits - Danny Elfman - The Nightmare Before Christmas OST (loop length 01:36.660)

<note, crossfade in at 1:13.100, fade out at 2:47.243 for 0:02.517>

I took a recording with my phone (excuse the ambient noise; there's only one speaker that produced a fairly loud output and I moved over there closer to the end of the recording. I picked up a few loops.)
