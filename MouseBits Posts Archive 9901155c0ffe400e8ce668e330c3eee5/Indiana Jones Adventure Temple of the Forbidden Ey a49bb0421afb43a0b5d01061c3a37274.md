# Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye Outdoor Queue Loop

*Posted by Aubrey on 10/14/2022*

As I am in the midst of compiling music loops for my site (a work in progress; I will post about it when it's done), I found that nobody bothered to post the full track list of songs - the only one on the web is duplicated on Magic Music/Disney Music Loops and lists three songs as unknowns. So, for convenience, let me post it here for future reference:

# **Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye Exterior Queue BGM**

1. (I've Got Spurs that) Jingle, Jangle, Jingle - Kay Kyser

*<Radio news>*

2. In the Mood - Glenn Miller and his Orchestra

3. There Goes That Song Again - Ginny Simms

4. In a Little Spanish Town - Tommy Dorsey

5. Let's Dance - Benny Goodman

*<Radio news>*

6. Indian Summer - Kay Kyser & Ginny Simms

7. Harlem River Dance - Claude Hopkins

8. Little Brown Jug - Glenn Miller and his Orchestra

*<Radio News>*

9. In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree - Claude Hopkins

10. Moonlight Serenade - Glenn Miller and his Orchestra

As Chris mentioned, the one loop that is in general circulation (~31:04) does appear to be an induction, likely two separate ones (a recording of the generator mixed with a recording of the radio). I went and poked my head around some YT videos to try and confirm that this recording matches what plays in the actual queue, just to be safe. I checked out ~8 videos, most of which had intermittent cuts, and found all of these songs featured except Harlem River Dance and Little Brown Jug, but that's probably just the luck of the draw.

With regards to Chris' question about additional songs being in the loop, I sincerely doubt it. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6IULYsAJ7I) contained bits and pieces of the songs "Moonlight Serenade", "Jingle Jangle Jingle", "In the Mood", and "There Goes That Song Again", in that order. This covers the gap between the end of the loop and the beginning of it, so unless there was some major edit, I think this is it. I'm glad we cleared that one up

Edit: BTW, given that Eddie Sotto apparently used the Living Era Hits Of... CDs to construct the Jungle Cruise Queue (see [this post](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9756.msg91961#msg91961)) it's safe to assume that "In the Mood" and "Indian Summer" likely came from the hits of '39 album.

There's also a number of Tower of Terror loop tracks that appear on it too!
