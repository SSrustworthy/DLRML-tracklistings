# Disneyland Resort Backlot Premiere Shop / World of Disney holiday loop

*Posted by Aubrey on 02/26/23*

This is a preliminary track list compiled by pixelated based off of his reference recording for the Disneyland Resort Backlot Premiere Shop holiday loop. The Backlot Premiere Shop opened on Stage 17 in Hollywood Land during the pandemic. This loop was also utilized as the World of Disney holiday loop (possibly with alterations) for the 2022 holiday season.

I calculated the track times based on his markers for possible track endings. Several of the tracks have long fadeouts which can get lost in the ambient noise. I checked on the tracks where edits were noted by pixelated and provided insight below.

The longest silent gap (~3.5 secs.) seems to be before Let It Snow by Lindsey Stirling. This is where I assigned the loop start.
