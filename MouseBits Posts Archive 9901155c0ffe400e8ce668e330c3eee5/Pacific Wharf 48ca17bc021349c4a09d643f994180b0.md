# Pacific Wharf

*Posted by Aubrey on 3/4/23*

This loop has been something of a peculiar case in that one track was ID‚Äôd in a Magic Music tracklist as ‚ÄúAt Play (WorldSong)‚Äù in 2002. However, no source album/artist/label has ever been found that contains the source track. IHeartGaming has recently found the source track itself, but not the source. So the mystery continues.

********IHeartGaming notes ‚ÄúThis file is not actually lossless. The original source is a 192 kbps MP3, and FLAC was only used in order to not introduce any additional lossy compression. Unfortunately, this brings me no closer to the source of "At Play" nor whatever WorldSong is.‚Äù

In celebration of finding this track in its 192 kbps glory, pixelated has generously given me access to a live recording for the sake of finding edit points. It is likely this loop will also soon disappear with the transformation of Pacific Wharf into San Fransokyo, so consider this a final salute.

These tracks tend to have long fadeouts, and it‚Äôs hard to know where the cutoff is between tracks. As such, I assigned the start of the track to the appearance of frequency (at any level) on the spectrogram. The loop lengths are then calculated from that location until the start of the next track. There is a possible loop start where there is no overlap between tracks between Streetbeat and Don Quixote, and about 1.045 seconds of silence. Only one track is edited with a late track start. There are no crossfades between tracks.
