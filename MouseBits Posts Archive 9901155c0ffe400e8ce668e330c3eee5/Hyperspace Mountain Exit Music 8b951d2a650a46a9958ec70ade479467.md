# Hyperspace Mountain Exit Music

*Posted by Aubrey on 01/29/2023*

The exit to Hyperspace Mountain appears to play “The Throne Room / End Title” from the Star Wars: A New Hope OST. This is audible on the exit staircase through the hallway that leads back to the concourse (where the restrooms and images are located).

I don’t have a recording in full, but listened to a few videos and most of the first three minutes of the album track is covered. It is unknown whether edits are present. Videos are from 2019, 2021, and 2022.

## Videos 1 and 2
