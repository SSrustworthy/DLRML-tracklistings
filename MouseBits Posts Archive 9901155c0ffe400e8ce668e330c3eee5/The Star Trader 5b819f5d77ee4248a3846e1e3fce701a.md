# The Star Trader

*Posted by Aubrey on 02/23/2023*

The Star Trader closed for refurbishment on July 27, 2010 and reopened with a Star Wars theme on May 6th, 2011 to coincide with the opening of Star Tours: The Adventures Continue.

On a recent visit, I noticed that there was a loop of Star Wars music in the store and took a short recording with my phone. Unfortunately, it was fairly loud and I wasn’t able to stay long, but I have a ~6 minute recording that I have ID’d from this partial loop recording (I also verified these by lining them up with their source tracks).
