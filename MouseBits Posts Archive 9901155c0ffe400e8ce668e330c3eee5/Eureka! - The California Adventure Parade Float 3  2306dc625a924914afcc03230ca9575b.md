Uh, uh, uh, uh

Come away with me

Uh, uh, uh, uh

Come away with me

Yup, check it out, all I got is hot

Cookin' up a groove in a melting pot

Like an egg gettin' fried on the sidewalk

I'm a freak for the heat of the dream talk

When I pan for the gold, let 'em dig my soul

Step into the zone of your starrin' role

Jump up to fun

To anything you're wantin' underneath the sun

I got what'll make you rock

24/7 all around your clock

Let me know when you've had your fill

'cause I got about a zillion ways to chill

What's fly and where it's at

Anything you want, I can be all that

Tick-tock, it's time

Hopscotch, you're mine

*Chorus*
Come away with me (Come away)

Come away with me (Ohh)

I’ll show you all you long to find

Ohhh

Come away with me (Come away)

Come away with me (Ohh)

To all you pictured in your in your mind

Ohhh

What do you wanna say

Come away with me (Come away with me)

Ohhh

I gotta shine on the time ‘kinda loving side (??)

Like a sun that'll never let a cloud make it hide

Zoom in like a cartwheelin’ fool

Flip into the rhythm of the golden rule

'cause I always wanna do unto your day

Whatever's gonna make you say you wanna stay

Adventures here and there

You know I’ve got it goin' on everywhere!

Take a tour of my state of mind

Leaving any other world far behind

You can parlay all I got

Into memories that fill with forget-me-nots

Rise at five what I'm all about

No dancin’ all around it

I wanna hear you shout it out

Eureka! I found it!

*Chorus*
Come away with me (Come away)

Come away with me (Ohh)

I’ll show you all you long to find

Ohhh

Come away with me (Come away)

Come away with me (Ohh)

To all you pictured in your in your mind

Ohhh

What do you wanna say

Come away with me (Come away with me)

Come away, Ohhh

Come away with me

What do you wanna see

Come away with me!

*Chorus*
Come away with me (Come away)

Come away with me (Ohh)

I’ll show you all you long to find (I’ll show you all)

Ohhh

Come away with me (Come away)

Come away with me (Ohh)

To all you pictured in your in your mind (All you pictured)

Ohhh

What do you wanna say (What do you wanna say)

Come away with me (Come away with me)

Uh, uh, uh, uh

Come away with me

Uh, uh, uh, uh

Come away with me

Yep, check it out (Yep, check it out)
