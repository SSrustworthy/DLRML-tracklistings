# Pixar Pierâ€™s Lamplight Lounge

*Posted by Aubrey on 09/30/2022*

Not much is documented about the exact BGM of the Pixar Pier Lamplight Lounge in DCA. However, it seems to have its fair share of admirers on reddit. From the below posts, the following three tracks have been identified:

1. Muy Tranquilo - Gramatik

1. Los Tarantos - Nickodemus

~~2. Contradance No. 3 In G Major - Classical Piano 101~~

*The second track, while identified in a Shazam screenshot, is very likely incorrect. It it just that: classical piano. It doesn't fit with the other tracks here.*

The "vibe" of this BGM is apparently "chillhop" or "lo-fi." There was a whole lot of uproar about a DJ named Pogo having his tracks featured in this BGM (due to his views), and so they were removed by the Parks from this playlist after many individuals contacted the company. It's unclear which of his tracks played in the restaurant, but it seems like there were multiple tracks that fell under the theme of Disney/Pixar remixes.
