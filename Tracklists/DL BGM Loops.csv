Main Street U.S.A.,Main Street U.S.A. v.1 [PRE],Unknown,"This exact loop is unverified, but is here as a placeholder for 1971-1976. This was a short reel composed of the album “Gay Nineties Waltzes” that was initially created for WDW’s 1971 opening. An anecdote from DL FLIGHT 295 offers that it definitely featured “Man on the Flying Trapeze,” which was removed from the 1976 loops.

Adventureland,Jungle Cruise Queue v.1,Unknown,"This loop played in the original Jungle Cruise queue. MightyTriton on Magic Music said “I also remember waiting in line under the grass thatched huts and there was a music loop in there. Music from African tribes played non stop. I remember trying to differentiate the songs from one another but they all sounded the same to me. The speakers were spread out and near the end of the switchbacks. The volume wasn't that loud unless you were directly under one of the speakers, so it did not interfere with all of the jungle sounds too much.” The Kenster said “There was the African Tribe music loop in the old Jungle Cruise queue. I couldn't tell one song from another.” See Magic Music, Re: https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/jungle-cruise-queue-bgm.3691/page-2 (2008) and https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disneyland-music-loops.17/page-3 (2002).",1,See loop notes,,,,,,,,,

Additional note from Djali999: Tracks did randomly pop in and out of loops in those days back when everything was being copied by hand onto reel-to-reel tapes which would degrade with time, so the missing tracks may or may not have been present at various points. This is the case most famously with the Big Thunder Mt queue loop, which is missing one track in Disneyland which was included in the Florida loop.
