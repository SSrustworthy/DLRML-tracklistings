Paradise Pier,,Paradise Pier,,,1,California Girls,,,,"Playlist compiled by tongoroa and posted 03/2002 on Magic Music of the Mouse discussion board.
This loop is not needledrop, and was composed on a Mortier 97 key organ (confirmed by CAScreaminDude from correspondence with DLR). Paradise Pier had five 'zones' of Area Music and all of them were synchronized and played the same basic titles in the same order. The 'zones' were: Boardwalk, Carousel, Stinger, Jelly ('under the sea' sounding: clari, rolling warm bells, steel drums), and Zephyr ('space' sounding: tubular bells, organ, theremin, glock). The entire Pier - all 'zones' - played 23 titles, all with different instrumentation, and all synchronized so that walking from one 'zone' to another was a gradual transition between instrumentation. The Boardwalk has 23 titles in its loop, as does the Carousel, etc., and all loops are the same length.",,,,,

The loop version simply cuts from the point right before that section to the point right after it with a deft cut that actually makes the track flow a little better than the original. What this means more importantly though is that, with the exception of the three non-needledrop (or otherwise unidentified at this point) tracks, it is possible to create an accurate reconstruction.",,,,,

Playlist compiled by C33.  Additional information provided by pixelated 11/2009 on http://www.mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=4884.msg35709#msg35709
 discussion board.  C33 notes: ""This loop played throughout Sunshine Plaza, Hollywood Pictures Backlot and Pacific Wharf, replacing those areas' normal loops during the festival run.
Except for the few second pause between the last track and the first track when the loop restarts, each track almost always begins over the ending of the previous one, with no gaps in between. In many cases the track will start to fade out before the next track begins and some of the tracks are edited to be shorter in length (sometimes significantly so), as indicated. The transitions are in some cases fairly jarring. For purists, creating an accurate reconstruction of the loop will be pretty much impossible without a reference recording to go by.
