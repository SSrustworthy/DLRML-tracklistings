Playlist compiled by C33.  Additional information provided by pixelated 11/2009 on http://www.mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=4884.msg35709#msg35709
 discussion board.  C33 notes: ""This loop played throughout Sunshine Plaza, Hollywood Pictures Backlot and Pacific Wharf, replacing those areas' normal loops during the festival run.
Except for the few second pause between the last track and the first track when the loop restarts, each track almost always begins over the ending of the previous one, with no gaps in between. In many cases the track will start to fade out before the next track begins and some of the tracks are edited to be shorter in length (sometimes significantly so), as indicated. The transitions are in some cases fairly jarring. For purists, creating an accurate reconstruction of the loop will be pretty much impossible without a reference recording to go by.

Avengers Campus,,Black Panther Celebration Garden [REF],00:25:58.597,"Tracklist compiled by pixelated based on his induction recording on Mousecord. The timecode values may be off because many of the source tracks start with fades and their use in the loop may overlap with the preceding track. That makes it harder to hear, and to see in the recording's spectrogram, when the track starts to play. The only edits are to ensure there are minimal silences between tracks. The loop's level drops but doesn't completely fade and is temporarily replaced by the United Nations/End Titles track for the arrival of Shuri at the garden.",1,Wake Up T'Challa,Ludwig Göransson,Black Panther OST,00:06:02.174,,,,,"November 11, 2022",
